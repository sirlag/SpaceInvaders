SpaceInvaders
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sirlag/SpaceInvaders.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sirlag/SpaceInvaders)

A 2.5d space invaders clone, using JMonkeyEngine, for an AP Computer Science Final Project.

#####Building


Make sure you have Java 8, and gradle 2.3+ installed. To build, simply run 

      gradle build
      
The main method is located in SpaceInvaders.java

All testing was completed in IntelliJ IDEA, however, when using an IDE to run the project, eclipse or netbeans with the Gradle plugin is equivlent.

There are some issues with running the game in fullscreen mode, mainly a freeze when prompted for initals, therefore it is highly discouraged.
